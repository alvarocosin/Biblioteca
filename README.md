# Biblioteca :books:
Biblioteca is a desktop app that navigates and manages data from a list of books from a personal home library.<br>
The main purpose of this application is to navigate a large collection of books easily, either by sorting alphabetically or by using a search bar to filter exactly the title or author you are looking for. <br>

## Usage :computer:
The data used for this is stored in a .csv, which previously was a .txt I wrote line by line, using the format of data separated by commas like a .csv, like this:
```bash
The Great Gatsby,F. Scott Fitzgerald,Álvaro
La náusea,Jean-Paul Sartre,Álvaro
Catch-22,Joseph Heller,Álvaro
Jane Eyre,Charlotte Brontë,Álvaro
El mito de Sísifo,Albert Camus,Álvaro
Crime and Punishment,Fiodor Dostoievski,Álvaro
```
The most important idea was to make a user friendly UI for this, as my parents would use the application too to check for books and make lists.
So a lot of use of big texts and soft colors was appropriate.<br>
<br>This is what the **main window** looks like:

## Final result :bookmark_tabs:
The main purpose of the tool is to be able to look for specific authors or books, and see if we have it and on what bookshelf it is, a sort function and a search bar were fundamental for the application to work well.

Finally, I added two extra functions to have the possibility to classify books by liked and pending/to read, using two separate windows inside the application.
